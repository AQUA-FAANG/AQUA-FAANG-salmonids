# AQUA-FAANG-salmonids

This repository contains the analysis scripts used for the manuscript titled "Regulatory evolution during rediploidization in salmonid fish."

The study presents large-scale regulatory omics datasets (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq) in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, spanning embryonic development (DevMap) and adult tissues (BodyMap), to investigate the evolution of gene expression and regulatory elements following the salmonid-specific Whole Genome Duplication (4R autotetraploidization).

## Repository Structure

The analysis scripts are organized into sub-directories, with each major section of the manuscript having its own folder. For clarity and reproducibility, scripts related to the main figures (Fig. 1 to Fig. 6) are placed within their corresponding analysis directories.
